## Summary


In the Star Wars application I got my hands dirty working with a REST API. Getting the data back from the API using asynchronous JavaScript was a little challenging at first, but once I understood the concept of promises I was able to retrieve the needed information for my UI. Sorting through the JSON data and manipulating it to display what I needed in the character table was awesome. Building this application helped me get stronger in my skillset using React components to create a pretty website.
